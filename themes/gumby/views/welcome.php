                Magdalene Reserve sits off of Fletcher Ave in the northwest part of the county. This small neighborhood is 
                barely noticeable, but inside there is no mistaking what makes this place different. Trees overhang the narrow 
                lanes that meander through the lush vegetation. In the midst of this garden-like setting, houses seem to 
                appear out of the woods as if they’ve always been there. It’s a far cry from the typical wide expanses of grass 
                with lollipop oaks, where stucco and asphalt shingles glare in the sun. Residents of Magdalene Reserve know 
                they have something special. That’s why many of them were attracted to the community.
